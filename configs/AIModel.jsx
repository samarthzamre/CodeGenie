I'm focusing on React, Tailwind CSS, and Lucide React. The JSON schema for the project structure is being finalized, ensuring clarity and ease of use.\n\n\n**Structuring the App's Layout**\n\nI'm structuring the app's components, focusing on React's reusability. I'm building `Header`, `Footer`, `TaskForm`, and `TaskList` components. Thinking about the state management and how to efficiently display/filter the tasks is my main focus. I'm considering using a context or a very simple state management solution, such as `useState`, if applicable.\n\n\n**Defining Key Features**\n\nNow, I'm focusing on the core functionality, like adding, editing, deleting, and filtering tasks, alongside persisting them using `localStorage`. Considering the task's data structure and filtering options is my priority. I'm aiming for concise, understandable components and functionalities.\n\n\n**Refining the UI/UX**\n\nI'm focused on the UI components, paying close attention to user interaction and visual flow, ensuring the app is both attractive and intuitive. I'm prioritizing accessibility and responsiveness. I'm designing with emojis for quick visual feedback and adding tooltips for clarity on icons and actions. I'm finalizing the file structure, ensuring everything is organized neatly.\n\n\n**Defining State and Logic**\n\nMy focus is now on the core logic and state management, I'm thinking about how the `TaskContext` will manage tasks and associated actions. I've designed the data structure for each task (title, due date, description, completed, and id). I'm also preparing to integrate `localStorage` to ensure persistence. I'm prioritizing efficient state updates. I also plan to add a filter functionality to streamline task management. Finally, I'm integrating the `react-chartjs-2` to illustrate the count of pending and completed tasks.\n\n\n**Outlining Project Files**\n\nNow, I'm focusing on defining the project's file structure, prioritizing the efficient utilization of Vite, React, Tailwind CSS, and other specified libraries. I'm finalizing the JSON structure for clarity and organization. I'm also planning to utilize the specified emojis for an intuitive user experience. Finally, I'm integrating a simple chart component using `react-chartjs-2`, aiming for a balance between functionality and a clean interface.\n\n\n"
